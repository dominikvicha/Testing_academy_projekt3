### Project description 
Its the final project of the Testing academy via Engeto. 3 basic web trest in playwright library. 

### Requiremts ###
- You need to install the Testing framework - Pytest.
- The official documentation is here: https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/  

- The project has 3 basic tests on page www.engeto.cz 
- Tests are automatizated so you dont need to click on anything just start the test. 

- Start it by: 
- pytest              (you can see just the "." it means passed.) 
- pytest --headed     (you can see what the test is doing in the real time) 
- OR pytest -s        (you can see the print statements in the terminal)   
- I suggest to start with pytest -s becouse in the code are few prints witch shows you the result of the test. 

If this doesnt work, make sure you have the right path for the main.py file, for example: pytest --headed python/python_learning/main.py

If anything feel free to message me. :)
